Test::Junkie
============

Continuous test runner for Perl 6

Initial version is based on masak's mini-tote Gist for all functionality.

See: https://gist.github.com/834500


Planned extensions
------------------

- pluggable implementations for running tests
- pluggable implementations for reporting 
- separate running from reporting
- option to 'make' before running tests in order to update blib/lib (should be useful for modules already installed
